1. I grew up in the â€™80s watching cheesy space opera cartoons. Robotech was my favourite. 
2. I have always wanted to try model building. 

So why not combine the above two? Introducing:

## The VF-1 S/A Strike/Super Gerwalk Valkyrie

I found this on amazon for a decent enough price along with a model building tool kit.

Oh good, the instructions are in Japanese.

## Project start

After several hours late at night on a couple of evenings, I have made it through steps 1 through 7. My initial attempts are very clumsy, and I need a lot more experience when it comes to painting. Completely botched the pilot. I am going to leave the outer decals and paint until I have better tools and equipment.
