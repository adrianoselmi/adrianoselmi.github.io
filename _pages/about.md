I am an Office 365 Solutions Architect working for [CPS][CPS-link] within the Modern Workplace department. My interest lies within the Office 365 services stack with most of my work being done in SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Power Platform, and any other services feeding into the communication and collaboration aspects of the platform.

## Blog

My blog posts will reflect on information I have had to find or figure out by delving around the intranet, books, and other people's minds to figure out and solve specific issues. 

## Project

My project posts will follow my own personal projects away from work and family.
