## Issue:

### Disable attachments in list

![Setting a attachments to disabled in the GUI](/images/20200611/disableattachments.gif "Diasbled Attachments")

There are no actions in site designs to set the attachments to disabled.

### Resolution

Not sure yet. Would most likely need to use PNP Provisioning in tandem with or instead of the site design.
